      <p><strong><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41610391/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meniscal Translation Under Loaded Motion After Posterior Horn Medial Meniscal Root Repair: A Cadaveric Biomechanical Evaluation</a></strong></p>
      <p class="small">The American journal of sports medicine • 2026 Jan 29 • PMID: 41610391</p>
      <p>BACKGROUND: Biomechanical evidence for adjustable posterior medial meniscal root (PMMR) fixation has shown promising results for meniscal root repair. Adjustable suture anchor (ASA) fixation has yet to be evaluated through the loaded knee range of motion. HYPOTHESIS: The ASA PMMR repair would restore meniscal translation similar to the native meniscus and maintain those parameters through the knee flexion arc during cyclical axial loading.</p>
      <p>RESULTS: Extrusion was significantly elevated in the PMMR released group compared with the native and repaired conditions at full extension (P = .0008), 30° (P = .007), 60° (P = .0008), 90° (P = .00006), and 100° (P = .0005). CONCLUSION: PMMR ASA repair resulted in decreased excursion and extrusion compared with the meniscal root tear condition, extrusion, and hoop strain approximated that of native, intact meniscus through axial loading and knee range of motion in a human cadaveric model.

      <p class="small">International journal of audiology • 2026 Jan 29 • PMID: 41609715</p>
      <p>OBJECTIVES: This scoping review provides an overview of aural rehabilitation with communication partners and analyses it using the Dyadic Regulation Connectivity Model. DESIGN: A scoping review. METHODS: Of 2,808 studies retrieved from five electronic databases up to August 2025, 17 were selected.</p>
      <p>RESULTS: Family members were the most common communication partners of older adults with hearing loss. Aural rehabilitation interventions improved patients&#x27; communication ability despite hearing loss and related challenges. Although aural rehabilitation improved partners&#x27; knowledge, attitudes, and responses towards hearing loss, few studies examined interaction or interdependence (Outcomes).</p>

      <p><strong><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41610355/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Functional Assessment of A Flexible Thermal Stimulation Device for Hand Edema Elimination in Stroke Survivors</a></strong></p>
      <p class="small">IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society • 2026 Jan 29 • PMID: 41610355</p>
      <p>Stroke survivors often suffer from severe discomfort caused by persistent hand edema, including hand pain, restricted knuckle mobility, and negative emotions, which significantly hinders normal rehabilitation progress. Whether physical or psychological in impact, the prevention and treatment of hand edema warrant significant attention throughout all stages of stroke rehabilitation. However, traditional rehabilitation therapies generally neglect edema management, focusing primarily on motor function recovery.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, participants in the TS group demonstrated improved hand function, including enhanced sensory perception and diminished pain.</p>

      <p class="small">Stroke (Hoboken, N.J.) • 2025 Nov • PMID: 41608723</p>
      <p>BACKGROUND: This study investigates the relationship between procedure time during stroke thrombectomy and acute posthospital disposition, as well as the associated costs. Despite extensive literature focusing on long-term outcomes, immediate posthospital patient disposition and its economic impact remain underexplored. METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed 721 patients undergoing thrombectomy at a single neuroendovascular practice from 2011 to 2020.</p>
      <p>RESULTS: PTR was significantly associated with disposition (P = 0.003). In adjusted multinomial regression, each 15-minute PTR increase was associated with higher odds of death/hospice (odds ratio [OR]: 1.020, 95% CI: [1.008-1.032], P =  0.001) and no significant change in acute/subacute rehab (OR: 1.007, 95% CI: [0.997-1.017], P = 0.152) and long-term care (OR: 1.007, 95% CI: [0.990-1.025], P = 0.432) relative to home/home with PT. CONCLUSION: Longer PTR is associated with increased death/hospice dispositions and measurable cost increases. Reported stats (from abstract): P = 0.003, P =  0.001, P = 0.152, P = 0.432, P&lt;0.001, OR.</p>
