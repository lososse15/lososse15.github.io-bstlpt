      <p><strong>Addressing Shoulder Weakness in Individuals With Rotator Cuff-Related Shoulder Pain: A Systematic Review With Meta-analysis</strong></p>
      <p class="small">J Orthop Sports Phys Ther • 2026 Feb • PMID: 41620837</p>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> This article explored oBJECTIVE: To estimate the effects of rehabilitation interventions on strength in people with rotator cuff-related shoulder pain (RCRSP). DESIGN: Intervention systematic review with meta-analysis. Overall, the findings suggest meta-analyses were conducted using standardized within-group mean difference from baseline to primary follow-up for each study intervention arm. Rehabilitation interventions had a moderate effect on shoulder external rotation strength (standardized mean difference [SMD], 0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.39, 0.74; I2 = 78%; P &lt; .01) and a small effect on shoulder abduction (SMD, 0.47; 95% CI: 0.32, 0.63; I2 = 54%; P &lt; .01), internal rotation (SMD, 0.41; 95% CI: 0.30, 0.52; I2 = 25%; P &lt; .08), flexion (SMD, 0.25; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.49; I2 = 0%; P = .46), and scaption (SMD, 0.48; 95% CI: 0.27, 0.70; I2 = 35%; P = .14) strength. Key numbers reported in the abstract include: 6 weeks.</p>
      <p><strong>Explain like I’m 5:</strong> This study tested a way to help people move better. It suggests the right kind of practice can improve strength or control. That can make everyday activities easier.</p>
      <p><strong>How to apply:</strong> Incorporate rotator cuff/scapular strengthening and progressive exposure to reaching/lifting based on irritability. Prioritize movement tolerance and function (reaching, overhead work), and progress dosage while monitoring next-day response. Study-reported dosage (from the abstract): 6 weeks.</p>

      <p><strong>Chinese expert consensus on dietary nutrition prescriptions and exercise intervention for sarcopenia (2025)</strong></p>
      <p class="small">Asia Pac J Clin Nutr • 2026 Feb • PMID: 41565227</p>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> This article explored sarcopenia, characterized by an age-associated decline in skeletal muscle mass and strength/function, is associated with multiple adverse clinical outcomes. Dietary nutrition and exercise interventions are effective ways to prevent and improve sarcopenia. Overall, the findings suggest sarcopenia, characterized by an age-associated decline in skeletal muscle mass and strength/function, is associated with multiple adverse clinical outcomes.</p>
      <p><strong>Explain like I’m 5:</strong> This study tested a way to help people move better. It suggests the right kind of practice can improve strength or control. That can make everyday activities easier.</p>
      <p><strong>How to apply:</strong> Use progressive strengthening plus balance and gait training to improve independence and reduce fall risk. Tie progress to objective tests (gait speed, TUG, sit-to-stand) and real-life function.</p>

      <p><strong>Brain-computer interfaces in poststroke rehabilitation: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials</strong></p>
      <p class="small">Neurosurg Focus • 2026 Feb 1 • PMID: 41621102</p>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> This article explored oBJECTIVE: Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability, with conventional rehabilitation often failing to achieve substantial motor recovery, particularly in patients with severe paresis or in chronic stages. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer a novel rehabilitation approach by translating neural signals into real-time external feedback. Overall, the findings suggest effect sizes were pooled using random-effects models and expressed as mean differences (MDs), standardized MDs (SMDs), or odds ratios, each with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Thirty-two RCTs comprising 1187 patients were included with no heterogeneity or significant imbalances in baseline characteristics across groups. Key numbers reported in the abstract include: p &lt; 0.01, p = 0.042, 95% CI 2.84-4.86, 95% CI 5.77-10.60, 95% CI 2.4-12.0, 95% CI 0.34-0.85.</p>
      <p><strong>Explain like I’m 5:</strong> This study looked at helping older people stay steady and avoid falls. It suggests that stronger legs and better balance can keep people from tipping over. Practice can make walking and standing safer.</p>
      <p><strong>How to apply:</strong> Use multicomponent fall-prevention programming: strength + balance + gait tasks, progressing from stable to dynamic environments and adding dual-task when safe. Reinforce home safety and confidence-building repetitions. Emphasize task-specific gait practice at an appropriate challenge level (speed, distance, variability). Use cueing/feedback and progress intensity safely while monitoring fatigue and cardiovascular response.</p>
