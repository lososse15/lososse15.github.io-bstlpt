      <p><strong>Dry Needling Plus Manual Therapy and Exercise for Subacromial Pain Syndrome: A Sham-Controlled Randomized Clinical Trial</strong></p>
      <p class="small">J Orthop Sports Phys Ther • 2026 Jan • PMID: 41476428</p>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect on Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) scores of adding dry needling to a program of exercise and manual therapy in individuals with subacromial pain syndrome (SAPS). DESIGN: Three-arm randomized trial involving 121 participants with SAPS. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect on Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) scores of adding dry needling to a program of exercise and manual therapy in individuals with subacromial pain syndrome (SAPS). Differences in the percentage of &quot;yes&quot; responses to the PASS were significant at 6 months between the PT+DN and PT Only groups (34% [14%-55%]) and the PT+DN and PT+SDN groups (24% [4%-45%]) and at 1 year between the PT+DN and PT+SDN groups (28% [7%-49%]). Key numbers reported in the abstract include: OR = 0.35, 6 months.</p>
      <p><strong>Explain like I’m 5:</strong> They wanted to learn what kind of practice helps people move better. They tried a plan and checked if it helped. The results can help therapists choose better exercises for people.</p>
      <p><strong>How to apply:</strong> Match the study population to your patient (diagnosis, age, stage of recovery, and goals). Study-reported dosage from the abstract: 6 months. Translate the main intervention into a measurable plan (frequency, intensity, time/sets/reps, and progression). Use objective measures to track change (pain + function + a performance test when appropriate). Educate on expectations and adjust based on symptom response, safety, and functional goals. For MSK care, use symptom-guided loading: progress volume/load while monitoring the 24-hour response and functional tolerance. Pair the approach with task practice relevant to goals (stairs, sit-to-stand, lifting, reaching) and reassess weekly.</p>

      <p><strong>Multifactorial approach training for anterior shoulder instability after a Latarjet procedure: protocol for a randomised controlled trial</strong></p>
      <p class="small">BMJ Open • 2026 Jan 21 • PMID: 41565337</p>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> INTRODUCTION: The Latarjet procedure is the mainstay treatment in high-demand patients with substantial glenoid bone loss or after failed capsulolabral repairs. Patients typically return to sport (RTS) within 6 months postoperatively, requiring intensive rehabilitation. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT06154889. Key numbers reported in the abstract include: 6 months, 4.5 months.</p>
      <p><strong>Explain like I’m 5:</strong> They wanted to learn what kind of practice helps people move better. They tried a plan and checked if it helped. The results can help therapists choose better exercises for people.</p>
      <p><strong>How to apply:</strong> Match the study population to your patient (diagnosis, age, stage of recovery, and goals). Study-reported dosage from the abstract: 6 months, 5 months. Translate the main intervention into a measurable plan (frequency, intensity, time/sets/reps, and progression). Use objective measures to track change (pain + function + a performance test when appropriate). Educate on expectations and adjust based on symptom response, safety, and functional goals. For sport rehab, integrate this into criteria-based progression (strength symmetry, hop/landing quality, workload tolerance) before return-to-sport. Use graded exposure to sport-specific drills and monitor training load to reduce flare-ups and reinjury risk.</p>

      <p><strong>Low-Intensity Blood Flow-Restricted Multi-Joint Exercise Improves Muscle Function in Patients With Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome: A Randomized Trial</strong></p>
      <p class="small">Med Sci Monit • 2026 Jan 29 • PMID: 41606964</p>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> BACKGROUND Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) limits physical activity and quality of life, especially during weight-bearing tasks. Although high-load resistance exercises are recommended for rehabilitation, they may worsen symptoms in pain-sensitive individuals. RESULTS The EG showed significantly greater improvements in knee strength, PPT, and balance (P&lt;0.05). Notably, significant increases in muscle tone were observed in the vastus medialis and lateralis muscles, as well as muscle stiffness in the vastus medialis and semitendinosus muscles. Key numbers reported in the abstract include: n=20, n=19, P&lt;0.05, 6 weeks.</p>
      <p><strong>Explain like I’m 5:</strong> They wanted to learn what kind of practice helps people move better. They tried a plan and checked if it helped. The results can help therapists choose better exercises for people.</p>
      <p><strong>How to apply:</strong> Match the study population to your patient (diagnosis, age, stage of recovery, and goals). Study-reported dosage from the abstract: 6 weeks. Translate the main intervention into a measurable plan (frequency, intensity, time/sets/reps, and progression). Use objective measures to track change (pain + function + a performance test when appropriate). Educate on expectations and adjust based on symptom response, safety, and functional goals. For older adults, prioritize fall-risk reduction: progressive strengthening + balance training (static → dynamic → dual-task) with home safety education. Tie outcomes to independence (gait speed, TUG, sit-to-stand, balance measures) and build confidence with safe repetitions.</p>

      <p><strong>Effects of task-oriented training on balance, gait, and fall in older adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials</strong></p>
      <p class="small">Aging Clin Exp Res • 2026 Jan 21 • PMID: 41566097</p>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> BACKGROUND: Task-oriented training(TOT) is a rehabilitation approach focused on practicing goal-oriented, functional tasks. AIMS: To investigate the effects of TOT compared with conventional training on improving balance, gait, and fall prevention in older adults(aged ≥ 60 years). Methodological quality was assessed using the PEDro scale and the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Minimal clinically important difference(MCID) values were determined by reviewing relevant literature. Key numbers reported in the abstract include: P &lt; 0.001, P = 0.03.</p>
      <p><strong>Explain like I’m 5:</strong> They wanted to learn what kind of practice helps people move better. They tried a plan and checked if it helped. The results can help therapists choose better exercises for people.</p>
      <p><strong>How to apply:</strong> Match the study population to your patient (diagnosis, age, stage of recovery, and goals). Translate the main intervention into a measurable plan (frequency, intensity, time/sets/reps, and progression). Use objective measures to track change (pain + function + a performance test when appropriate). Educate on expectations and adjust based on symptom response, safety, and functional goals. For neuro rehab, emphasize task-specific, high-repetition practice (walking, transfers, balance tasks) with appropriate cueing and safety setup. Progress difficulty by changing speed, environment, and cognitive load while monitoring fatigue and safety.</p>
