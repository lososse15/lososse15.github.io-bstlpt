      <p><strong>Exploring pain conceptualization in relation to outcomes in patients with chronic low back pain: a prospective observational study</strong></p>
      <p class="small">Croat Med J • 2026 Jan 5 • PMID: 41520202</p>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> This study looked at to examine the relationship between pain conceptualization and treatment outcomes in patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain (CNSLBP) undergoing physiotherapy, and to explore the influence of educational attainment on pain conceptualization. The authors used this prospective observational study enrolled 84 adults (mean age ≈50 years) receiving exercise-based physiotherapy for CNSLBP in an outpatient setting. Outcome measures included pain intensity (Numeric Pain Rating Scale), disability (Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire), and health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L index and EQ-VAS), assessed before and after treatment. Pain conceptualization was measured with the Croatian version of the Concept of Pain Inventory for Adults (COPI-Adult). Overall, significant post-treatment improvements were observed in pain (-2.41), disability (-5.27), EQ-5D-5L index (+0.128), and EQ-VAS (+13.79) (all P&lt;0.001). Higher COPI-Adult scores were weakly and negatively correlated with pain (r = -0.273, P = 0.012) and disability (r = -0.259, P = 0.018), and positively with HRQoL (EQ-5D-5L: r = 0.295; In practical terms, while pain conceptualization is associated with post-treatment pain, disability, and HRQoL outcomes, it does not predict the degree of improvement after physiotherapy. Educational attainment influences pain conceptualization, which indicates a need for tailored communication strategies in rehabilitation. The Croatian COPI-Adult is a reliable tool for assessing patients&#x27; concepts of pain within CNSLBP care. Key numbers reported in the abstract include: P&lt;0.001, P = 0.012, P = 0.018, P &gt; 0.005, P = 0.014.</p>

      <p><strong>Physiotherapy Compared With Shockwave Therapy for the Treatment of Proximal Hamstring Tendinopathy: A Randomized Controlled Trial</strong></p>
      <p class="small">Am J Sports Med • 2025 Dec • PMID: 41243328</p>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> This study looked at to investigate the effectiveness of individualized physiotherapy compared with shockwave therapy on pain and function in PHT. The authors used this prospective parallel-group, assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT) was set in 10 primary care physiotherapy practices in Victoria, Australia. A total of 100 participants with PHT were randomly assigned to receive 6 sessions of either individualized physiotherapy or shockwave therapy, with both groups receiving standardized advice and education. Primary outcomes were global rating of change on a 7-point Likert scale and the Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment Scale for Proximal Hamstring Tendinopathy at 4, 12, 26, and 52 weeks postrandomization. Analyses were by intention-to-treat using linear mixed models. Overall, all except 1 patient received the allocated intervention, and the participant follow-up rate was 88% at 12 months. There were no significant differences between groups in primary outcomes at any time point. For secondary outcome measures, participants in the shockwave group had statistically significantly greater satisfaction with treatment at 26 weeks, satisfaction with results of treatment at 4 and 26 weeks, and general health at 52 weeks. Responder analyses of participants achieving clinically significant improvements showed no significant differences between groups at any time point. In practical terms, this RCT found no difference in effectiveness of individualized physiotherapy compared with shockwave therapy on global effect or function in PHT. Future trials on PHT appear feasible but could explore a different sample population or other intervention and/or comparison groups. Key numbers reported in the abstract include: 52 weeks, 12 months, 26 weeks.</p>

      <p><strong>Effect of Baduanjin exercise on sarcopenia in older adult patients: a multicenter, randomized controlled trial</strong></p>
      <p class="small">Front Public Health • 2025 • PMID: 41602047</p>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> This study looked at sarcopenia is an age-related syndrome characterized by muscle loss and reduced muscle strength, with a high incidence rate, significantly increasing the risk of falls, fractures, and death. Baduanjin, a traditional Chinese exercise, compared with traditional rehabilitation programs, has low intensity, high safety and strong interest, and is particularly suitable for patients who cannot tolerate high-intensity exercise. This study will evaluate the therapeutic effect of Baduanjin on sarcopenia. METHOD/ The authors used this trial is a multicenter randomized controlled trial that will recruit 200 participants,and is randomized (1: 1) the subjects to the intervention group (Baduanjin + health education + dietary guidance, BHD) and the control group (health education + dietary guidance, HD). After enrollment, health lectures were given to all subjects. The intervention group received 12 weeks of Baduanjin intervention, with each class lasting 70 min, once a week, and provide online guidance for home workouts four times a week, while the control group maintained their original exercise habits. Health education and dietary guidance were also provided. Observation indicators will be tested before the trial begins and during the follow-up period after the intervention ends. Key numbers reported in the abstract include: 12 weeks.</p>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> This study looked at dizziness is a common condition that can significantly reduce quality of life and increase the risk of falls. This review examines frequent vestibular causes, including benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, vestibular migraine, Ménière&#x27;s disease, and vestibular neuritis. Overall, dizziness is a common condition that can significantly reduce quality of life and increase the risk of falls. Given the significant variation in implementation across Denmark, it is essential to prioritise efforts for improved quality, standardisation, and comprehensive training nationwide.
