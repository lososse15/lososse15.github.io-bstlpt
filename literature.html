      <p><strong>Outcome measures used for evaluating the effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A scoping review</strong></p>
      <p class="small">Knee Surg Sports Traumatol Arthrosc • 2026 Jan 28 • PMID: 41603550</p>

      <p><strong>Background:</strong> This scoping review aims to identify and synthesise the most frequently used outcome measures for physiotherapy after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) to support the selection of methods used in future randomised controlled trials.</p>
      <p><strong>Results:</strong> Out of 4905 identified studies, 289 were included in the review, identifying 82 distinct outcome measures, none of which were used in more than 30% of the included studies. PROMs were used 380 times. The most commonly reported PROMs were the Lysholm knee scoring scale (25.3%), the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC Subjective Knee Form) (23.9%), the visual analogue scale (VAS) (21.8%), the knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS) (13.2%) and the tegner activity scale (12.5%). PBOMs were used 341 times across the included studies. The most frequently applied PBOMs were the isokinetic dynamometer under concentric conditions (29.1%), hop tests (19.0%) and the isometric dynamometer (18.7%). Impairment-based outcome measures were used 312 times and were the least frequently applied. The most common impairment-based outcome measures included goniometric assessment of range of motion (28.4%), arthrometric measurements (18.7%) and swelling assessment using a measuring tape (12.5%). The most frequently used PBOMs were the isokinetic dynamometer (concentric conditions), hop tests and the isometric dynamometer.</p>
      <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Results of a scoping review indicate significant heterogeneity in the outcome measures used to evaluate physical therapy interventions after ACLR. The lack of clear recommendations for reporting outcomes complicates comparisons between studies and limits the ability to synthesise evidence in systematic reviews and meta-analyses.</p>
      <p><strong>How to apply this:</strong> Confirm the population and setting match your caseload. If applicable, implement the main intervention principles (dose, intensity, frequency, progression) and track response with objective outcomes (pain scale, PSFS/ODI/LEFS/QuickDASH as appropriate, strength/ROM, gait speed, balance measures). Educate on expectations, monitor tolerance/safety, and individualize based on goals, comorbidities, and baseline function.</p>

      <p><strong>A Novel Physeal-Sparing Fixation Technique for Tibial Eminence Fractures in Paediatric Patients</strong></p>
      <p class="small">Cureus • 2025 Dec • PMID: 41602261</p>

      <p><strong>Background:</strong> Introduction Tibial eminence fractures are common knee injuries in paediatric patients. They are an uncommon cause of knee injury that is associated with effusion, and most frequently present in the paediatric population.</p>
      <p><strong>Results:</strong> These injuries affect knee stability. Surgical management is challenging and associated with risks and complications due to the direct relation to the proximal tibial growth plate. We developed a new physeal-sparing technique to fix these fractures while avoiding any violation of the proximal tibial growth plate.</p>
      <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Further long-term studies and clinical trials are required to compare the results with other fixation methods that are currently in use.</p>
      <p><strong>How to apply this:</strong> Confirm the population and setting match your caseload. If applicable, implement the main intervention principles (dose, intensity, frequency, progression) and track response with objective outcomes (pain scale, PSFS/ODI/LEFS/QuickDASH as appropriate, strength/ROM, gait speed, balance measures). Educate on expectations, monitor tolerance/safety, and individualize based on goals, comorbidities, and baseline function.</p>

      <p><strong>A Physical Therapy Mobility Checkup is Feasible With Annual Wellness Visits in Primary Care</strong></p>
      <p class="small">Phys Ther • 2026 Jan 29 • PMID: 41609116</p>

      <p><strong>Background:</strong> IMPORTANCE: Screening older adults for mobility disability and preclinical mobility limitation (PCML) does not routinely occur. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to: (1) determine the feasibility of implementing a preventive physical therapy mobility checkup in primary care and (2) determine if 1 mobility checkup shifts the self-efficacy of older adults for meeting activity recommendations.</p>
      <p><strong>Results:</strong> Ten of 12 feasibility criteria were met. The total mean retrospective-pre SEE survey score was 6.39 (SD = 2.54) and the total mean post-SEE survey score was 7.61 (SD = 1.97). There were 62 positive shifts, 3 negative, and 14 unchanged with the retrospective pre-post SEE survey. Key stats reported in the abstract: N = 80.</p>
      <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> A mobility checkup in primary care is feasible and may increase the self-efficacy of older adults for meeting activity guidelines.</p>
