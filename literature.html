      <p><strong>Effects of instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization combined with exercise on knee joint muscle activity during walking in patients with moderate knee osteoarthritis: A randomized controlled clinical trial</strong></p>
      <p class="small">Sci Rep • 2025 Dec 29 • PMID: 41462049</p>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> This article explored knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a degenerative joint disorder characterized by pain and stiffness, often leading to compensatory increases in muscle activity. Instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM) is an emerging manual therapy with potential benefits in soft tissue release and pain management. Overall, the findings suggest significant group*time interactions were observed for the vastus medialis, semitendinosus, and tibialis anterior, with post-treatment EMG activity decreasing in the IASTM group and increasing in the sham group. A significant speed*time interaction for the vastus lateralis revealed more pronounced post-treatment reductions during fast walking, with a trend toward decreased activity in the IASTM group and increased activity in the sham group.</p>
      <p><strong>Explain like I’m 5:</strong> This study looked at people with achy, stiff knees from arthritis. It suggests certain exercises can help the knee work better and hurt less. Moving and strengthening in the right way helps daily activities feel easier.</p>
      <p><strong>How to apply:</strong> Use progressive strengthening (quads/hips), functional training (sit-to-stand, stairs), and aerobic activity as tolerated. Track pain and function (e.g., LEFS/KOOS, sit-to-stand, gait speed), and progress load while keeping flare-ups manageable.</p>

      <p><strong>Dry Needling Plus Manual Therapy and Exercise for Subacromial Pain Syndrome: A Sham-Controlled Randomized Clinical Trial</strong></p>
      <p class="small">J Orthop Sports Phys Ther • 2026 Jan • PMID: 41476428</p>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> This article explored oBJECTIVE: To determine the effect on Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) scores of adding dry needling to a program of exercise and manual therapy in individuals with subacromial pain syndrome (SAPS). DESIGN: Three-arm randomized trial involving 121 participants with SAPS. Overall, the findings suggest oBJECTIVE: To determine the effect on Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) scores of adding dry needling to a program of exercise and manual therapy in individuals with subacromial pain syndrome (SAPS). Differences in the percentage of &quot;yes&quot; responses to the PASS were significant at 6 months between the PT+DN and PT Only groups (34% [14%-55%]) and the PT+DN and PT+SDN groups (24% [4%-45%]) and at 1 year between the PT+DN and PT+SDN groups (28% [7%-49%]). Key numbers reported in the abstract include: OR = 0.35, 6 months.</p>
      <p><strong>Explain like I’m 5:</strong> This study tested a way to help people move better. It suggests the right kind of practice can improve strength or control. That can make everyday activities easier.</p>
      <p><strong>How to apply:</strong> Incorporate rotator cuff/scapular strengthening and progressive exposure to reaching/lifting based on irritability. Prioritize movement tolerance and function (reaching, overhead work), and progress dosage while monitoring next-day response.</p>

      <p><strong>Effects of Artificial Intelligence Recognition-Based Telerehabilitation on Exercise Capacity in Patients With Hypertension: Randomized Controlled Trial</strong></p>
      <p class="small">J Med Internet Res • 2026 Jan 13 • PMID: 41529829</p>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> This article explored bACKGROUND: Hypertension remains a major global health challenge, significantly increasing cardiovascular and all-cause mortality risks. While exercise therapy is effective, conventional approaches face limitations in accessibility and personalization, compromising adherence. Overall, the findings suggest after 8 weeks, the intervention group demonstrated significantly greater improvements than the control group in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD; adjusted mean difference 62.77, 95% CI 26.33-99.22; P=.002), systolic BP reduction (adjusted mean difference 4.11, 95% CI 0.11-8.28; P=.046), IPAQ score (adjusted mean difference 658.96, 95% CI 159.23-1158.69; P=.011), exercise self-efficacy score (adjusted mean difference 21.71, 95% CI 13.59-29.82; P&lt;.001), total exercise time (adjusted mean difference 98.24, 95% CI 49.39-147.08; P=.001) peak oxygen uptake (peak VO2) (adjusted mean difference 3.39, 95% CI 0.49-6.29; P=.026), and peak oxygen uptake percent predicted (peak VO2%pred) (adjusted mean difference 11.58, 95% CI 2.06-21.10; P=.021). Key numbers reported in the abstract include: 95% CI 26.33-99.22, 95% CI 0.11-8.28, 95% CI 159.23-1158.69, 95% CI 13.59-29.82, 95% CI 49.39-147.08, 95% CI 0.49-6.29, 95% CI 2.06-21.10, 8 weeks.</p>
      <p><strong>Explain like I’m 5:</strong> This study looked at helping older people stay steady and avoid falls. It suggests that stronger legs and better balance can keep people from tipping over. Practice can make walking and standing safer.</p>
      <p><strong>How to apply:</strong> Use multicomponent fall-prevention programming: strength + balance + gait tasks, progressing from stable to dynamic environments and adding dual-task when safe. Reinforce home safety and confidence-building repetitions. Study-reported dosage (from the abstract): 50 minutes, 8 weeks.</p>

      <p><strong>Trunk Impairment Scale and Stroke Impact Scale for Clinical Assessment of Patients in the Subacute Stage After Stroke Following Sensory Intervention</strong></p>
      <p class="small">Physiol Res • 2025 Dec 31 • PMID: 41532635</p>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> This article explored stroke survivors frequently present with impaired trunk control, which is a key determinant of mobility, balance, and independence in activities of daily living (ADL). Reliable clinical tools are therefore needed to evaluate postural stability, particularly in patients unable to stand. Overall, the findings suggest both groups demonstrated significant improvements in trunk control, mobility, strength and ADL over time, as reflected by higher TIS and SIS scores. Mobility improvements were strongly associated with enhanced ADL performance, underscoring the relevance of trunk control rehabilitation.</p>
      <p><strong>Explain like I’m 5:</strong> This study looked at helping older people stay steady and avoid falls. It suggests that stronger legs and better balance can keep people from tipping over. Practice can make walking and standing safer.</p>
      <p><strong>How to apply:</strong> Use multicomponent fall-prevention programming: strength + balance + gait tasks, progressing from stable to dynamic environments and adding dual-task when safe. Reinforce home safety and confidence-building repetitions. Emphasize task-specific gait practice at an appropriate challenge level (speed, distance, variability). Use cueing/feedback and progress intensity safely while monitoring fatigue and cardiovascular response.</p>
