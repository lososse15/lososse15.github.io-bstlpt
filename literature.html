      <p><strong>Effectiveness of immersive virtual reality and exercise on clinical, clinimetric and biomarker variables in rotator cuff-related shoulder pain patients: A study protocol for a multicentre randomized clinical trial (IVR- RCRSP-Rehab)</strong></p>
      <p class="small">PLoS One • 2026 • PMID: 41592018</p>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> INTRODUCTION: Shoulder pain is a common reason for physiotherapy consultations, and the high prevalence of rotator cuff-related shoulder pain (RCRSP) calls for novel approaches. Immersive virtual reality (IVR) offers an innovative treatment option to reduce pain, improve mobility and function in RCRSP. RESULTS: This study will shed light on the effectiveness of the combined program of immersive virtual reality with exercise and exercise program alone in chronic RCRSP patients. The results will provide valuable insights into the additive effects of IVR on variables such as pain, function, psychosocial factors and biological markers, potentially informing future rehabilitation strategies and enhancing patient outcomes in musculoskeletal care. Key numbers reported in the abstract include: 3 months.</p>
      <p><strong>How to apply:</strong> Match the study population to your patient and translate the main intervention approach into a measurable PT plan (dosage, frequency, intensity, and progression). Track objective outcomes relevant to the condition (e.g., pain scale, PSFS/ODI/LEFS/QuickDASH, strength/ROM, gait speed, balance measures), educate the patient on expectations, and adjust the program based on response, safety, and functional goals.</p>

      <p><strong>Immediate physical therapy is beneficial for adolescent athletes with active lumbar spondylolysis: a multicentre randomised trial</strong></p>
      <p class="small">Br J Sports Med • 2026 Jan 19 • PMID: 41402030</p>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of initiating physical therapy (PT) immediately versus resting before starting PT on pain and dysfunction over 12 months in adolescent athletes (10-19 years) with active lumbar spondylolysis. METHODS: This prospective multicentre trial randomised participants to immediate PT or rest before PT. RESULTS: Sixty-four participants (median age 14.2 years; 40% female) were randomised to immediate PT (n=30) and rest before PT (n=34). At 1 month, the immediate PT group showed significant improvements in pain and disability (mean difference on Micheli Functional Scale of 21.3, 95% CI 28.7 to 13.9; p&lt;0.001). Key numbers reported in the abstract include: n=30, n=34, p&lt;0.001, p=0.01, 12 months, 7 days, 1 month, 38 days.</p>

      <p><strong>Effects of task-oriented training on balance, gait, and fall in older adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials</strong></p>
      <p class="small">Aging Clin Exp Res • 2026 Jan 21 • PMID: 41566097</p>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> BACKGROUND: Task-oriented training(TOT) is a rehabilitation approach focused on practicing goal-oriented, functional tasks. AIMS: To investigate the effects of TOT compared with conventional training on improving balance, gait, and fall prevention in older adults(aged ≥ 60 years). Methodological quality was assessed using the PEDro scale and the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Minimal clinically important difference(MCID) values were determined by reviewing relevant literature. Key numbers reported in the abstract include: P &lt; 0.001, P = 0.03.</p>

      <p><strong>Safety and efficacy of the Atalante exoskeleton in the rehabilitation of French patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a prospective, monocentric, open, uncontrolled, interventional protocol, EXALS</strong></p>
      <p class="small">BMJ Open • 2026 Jan 16 • PMID: 41545051</p>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> INTRODUCTION: Robotic rehabilitation on locomotion is a new approach in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and previous studies showed its feasibility. In this study, we aim to evaluate safety, patient&#x27;s experience and efficacy of a gait training programme with the Atalante exoskeleton, compared with usual care, on walking ability, functional capacity and other symptoms associated with ALS. Nominal outcomes are evaluated using Cochran&#x27;s Q test with McNemar pairwise comparisons when significant. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals and conferences.NCT06199284. Key numbers reported in the abstract include: 6 weeks.</p>
      <p><strong>How to apply:</strong> Match the study population to your patient and translate the main intervention approach into a measurable PT plan (dosage, frequency, intensity, and progression). Track objective outcomes relevant to the condition (e.g., pain scale, PSFS/ODI/LEFS/QuickDASH, strength/ROM, gait speed, balance measures), educate the patient on expectations, and adjust the program based on response, safety, and functional goals.</p>
